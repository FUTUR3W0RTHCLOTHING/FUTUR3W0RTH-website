            <h2>The Story of FUTUREWORTH</h2>
            <p>
                It started during Mr. Vinke's math class when Xairo, Milan, Tygo, Bram, and David sat brainstorming ideas instead of solving equations. Xairo sketched a logo with the name <em>Highlight</em> and suggested they start a clothing brand.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Highlight makes sense,” Milan said. “It’s about standing out.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Tygo started jotting down ideas. “Simple designs with powerful messages, like ‘Confidence is Key.’”
            </p>
            <p>
                Bram added, “Everyone in school would wear it!”
            </p>
            <p>
                David searched the name online but frowned. “It’s taken.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Disappointed but not defeated, Xairo said, “What’s our goal? To make people feel like they’re worth it, like their future matters.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Futureworth,” Milan suggested. The name stuck.
            </p>
            <p>
                That evening, the group met and combined their talents. Xairo refined the logo, Tygo planned the business, Milan styled the designs, Bram promoted, and David created a website. They launched a small line of shirts and hoodies with slogans like “Your Future is Worth It.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Soon, classmates, neighbors, and even strangers started buying. FUTUREWORTH grew quickly, fueled by their teamwork and belief in their message.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Do you think we can make it big?” Tygo asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                “We already are,” Xairo replied, smiling.
            </p>
            <p>
                Five kids with a classroom dream turned their brand into a movement, inspiring everyone to believe their future is worth it.
